My role within the project was to identify the geographic presence of various wind turbine operators and their parent companies across the United States.  Companies with a stronger presence in multiple states are better candidates for investment. 

Tasks completed are as follows:
* identify the operators/ parent companies with the widest geographic distribution across the US
* visualise the geographic distribution of top companies on a map
* match operator names with their parent company names (using fuzzywuzzy match)
* distinguish operators/ parent companies with a strong presence in individual states from operators/ parent companies with a broader reach but fewer turbines per state.  


Additional tasks:
* visualised companies on a map via their efficiency of power generation per turbine
* wrote summary of assumptions, limitations and caveats for the overall data analysis (slide 10 on Gust Gurus final presentation)
