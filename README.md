<a name="globalFood"></a>
### Global Food Distribution (Power BI dashboard) | General Assembly (Nov 2023) <sub><sup><a href="#top" style="font-size:smaller;">↑ Back to Top</a></sup></sub>
Analysis of sales data for global food distribution company with presence in US, Europe and Japan - completed as a lab exercise with General Assembly.  Used Power BI to derive insights to client's products sales and marketing in these countries.  Identified: top selling products, trends in sales for these products, customers generating highest sales.  Comparison was made of sales in US vs Europe.  Recommendations made to maximise portfolio profitability to US and Europe, and recommendations made for exploring untapped markets in Europe.

**Dashboard comprises:** 


_1. High-level metrics:_ Sales by product group, top 5 sales by customer, quarterly sales by region, monthly sales YOY (filtered by: year/qtr/month, region)

_2. Product details:_ monthly sales YOY, sales by product group with gross margin %, tree map: product group by total sales (filtered by: region)

_3. Customer details:_ Scatterplot: qty of product sold vs sales (labelled by customer name), table: customer/ product group/ product type, sales/ qty/ margin/ avg sales per invoice (filtered by: year/qtr/month, manager)

_4. Customer location:_ Map: cities, bubble size = sales amount.  (filtered by: product group, region, year)

### COVID Data Journalism (Tableau Story) | General Assembly (Dec 2023) <sub><sup><a href="#top" style="font-size:smaller;">↑ Back to Top</a></sup></sub>
Analysis of COVID dataset from Our World In Data: used a series of Tableau visualisations to address the question "Where is the coronavirus situation the worst?"  Animation of global spread was created, looking at population adjusted cases by month.  Density of cases was compared with death rates across the same countries.  CFR (Case Fatality Ratio) was calculated to assess burden of disease from COVID by country. Countries with highest deaths (poor performers) per million vs countries with lowest CFR (good performers) were compared across a number of metrics including: testing and vaccination rates, population density, available hospital beds, lockdown severity, wealth, life expectancy, burden of chronic disease, age distribution.

### Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis - SQL | General Assembly (Nov 2023) <sub><sup><a href="#top" style="font-size:smaller;">↑ Back to Top</a></sup></sub>
Data analysis of liquor sales across various counties in Iowa - used online database of alcohol sales in Iowa 2014.  Top performing products and vendors were identified, and sales report was generated.  Trend of sales by month was analysed.  Distribution of stores by latitude and longitude was analysed.  Daily alcohol spend per capita by county was calculated and visualised on a map using Tableau.
