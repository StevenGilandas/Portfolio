### Global Food Distribution (Power BI dashboard) | General Assembly (Nov 2023)
Analysis of sales data for global food distribution company with presence in US, Europe and Japan - completed as a lab exercise with General Assembly.

Recommendations made to maximise portfolio profitability to US and Europe, and recommendations made for exploring untapped markets in Europe.

**Dashboard comprises:** 


_1. High-level metrics:_ Sales by product group, top 5 sales by customer, quarterly sales by region, monthly sales YOY (filtered by: year/qtr/month, region)

_2. Product details:_ monthly sales YOY, sales by product group with gross margin %, tree map: product group by total sales (filtered by: region)

_3. Customer details:_ Scatterplot: qty of product sold vs sales (labelled by customer name), table: customer/ product group/ product type, sales/ qty/ margin/ avg sales per invoice (filtered by: year/qtr/month, manager)

_4. Customer location:_ Map: cities, bubble size = sales amount.  (filtered by: product group, region, year)
