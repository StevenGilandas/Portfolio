# Data Analyst

## Profile
I am a Data Analyst with an interest in Biostatistics. Fulfilling work for me is approaching a problem in a creative way and building solutions that are technically robust. I treat my technical output as a teaching opportunity - a way to engage with people and build knowledge. I’m particularly interested in using population health data to solve systemic problems in the way healthcare is delivered to communities.
